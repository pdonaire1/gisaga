# NOTE TO TRANSLATORS:
#    Do not translate the '{attachments}' part of any of the right-hand
#    strings below!  It must appear exactly as '{attachments}' in the
#    article/parent text in order for the substitutions to work correctly in
#    'custom placement' mode.!

ATTACHMENTS_TOKEN=Insert {attachments} token
ATTACHMENTS_TOKEN_ALREADY_PRESENT=The {attachments} token is already present.  It can only appear in one location in the text!
ATTACHMENTS_TOKEN_DESCRIPTION=Place the cursor in the location where you want the attachments list to display (in the front end) and then click on this button. This inserts the {attachments} token that the 'Custom Placement' option uses. Some HTML is also added to hide the token when attachments lists are not shown.
INSERT_ATTACHMENTS_TOKEN_BUTTON_PLUGIN_INSTALLED=Adds a button that allows you to insert an {attachments} custom placement token while editing.
