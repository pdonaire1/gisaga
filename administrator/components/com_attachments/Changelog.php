   - Added admin functions to disable uninstallation of attachments 
     table (for MySQL).
   - Created new update.php file in admin area and set up an "Extras"

   - Restored the Attachment logo in the back end.
   - Added file type icons for mp3, wma, and aiff files.
   - Changed display of modification date to include Locale (eg time
     zone offset).  Note that this change required changing the format

     configuration settings (config.xml) to reflect this change.
   - Fixed code that allowed any user to delete other folks attachments
     (in the 'who can add' == 'any logged-in user' mode).  Now anyone

     manipulation functions from php functions to JFile functions (which)
     use FTP if it is enabled.
   - Attachments plugin changed from onAfterDisplayContent event to 
     onPrepareContent event.  This ensures that it respects the ordering
     requested for plugins (which are apparently mostly onPrepareContent).
   - Reworked permissions checking: Put all permissions function into a 
     separate file (site/permissions.php).   Got rid of 'verify_*' functions
     in helper.php in favor of similar functions in permissions.php.
   - Converted all require() to require_once()
   - Implemented code to update attachments from the frontend.
   - Converted most Javascript alert()/confirm() dialogs to use
     non-Javascript approaches such as reloading the forms, raising
     an http error (code 500), or dialogs/warnings via iframes.
   - Added views for uploading and updating.  Now the file for an attachment
     can be upgraded from the front end or back end.
   - Minor rework to get update_null_dates() working from both the 
     special controller and from the installation script.
   - Changed processing of 'hide attachments for' option to allow
     either '_' or '-' characters between words.
   - Reduced the extra MySQL indeces to only 'article_id' (MySQL adds an
     index for 'id' automatically).  According to MySQL documentation,
     the other indeces will give no benefit.  See:
     http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/order-by-optimization.html
   - Added quotes to download Content-Disposition to make sure
     downloading filenames with spaces works in secure mode (does not
     affect non-secure mode).
   - Various fixes from feedback from the testers.
   - Tested with Joomla! 1.5.3 (Vahi))

   - Added French tranlation by Pascal Adalian (Thanks Pascal!)
   - Added special controller/view with some special functions in the 
     Administrative back end to assist with automated testing of the 
     Attachments extension.  For the most part, these functions duplicate
     functionality available in other admin locations, without Javascript.
     (No new user or admin functionality added; normal user and admin 
     functions are unaffected.)
   - Fixed a small bug in back end to prevent attachments from being
     attached to articles that are in the trash.
   - A few minor tweaks to the English version of the help file.

     read privileges).	This is needed on a few website server configurations,
     and it should harmless on the rest.
   - When an article is moved to another article in the attachment editor
     (in the back end), if the prepend mode is 'article_id', the filename_sys
     and url are renamed to avoid future filename conflicts.
   - Cleaned up all the help files to have valid HTML (using W3C validator).
   - Added fix to SQL code in admin controller.php (LEFT JOIN instead of JOIN).
     This fix seems to keep some older versions of MySQL happy.

     various language files accordingly; integrated updates from all translators.

     editing articles from the front end.

     so that the article editor is undisturbed (both front end and back end).
   - Add the ability to change the article of an attachment through the
     attachment editing form in the back end (look for [Change Article]).
     NOTE: This version does not rename the actual file, so unexpected filename
     conflicts are possible.  This will be fixed in the next version.
   - Got the spell checker working on my editor and fixed numerous typos.
